\chapter{MBDyn Adapter and its integration}
\label{cha:adapter}


To prepare an existing simulation code for coupling, preCICE has to be integrated with the solver, using  API described in Section \ref{sec:pc-api} and in Appendix \ref{sec:api-code}. The "glue-code" required for this operation is called \textit{adapter}, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:adapter-scheme}.

\section{Design of the adapter structure}


In order to couple MBDyn with preCICE a C++ adapter has been implemented within the scope of this work. The \textit{adapter} needs to be integrated with both the MBDyn solver and the coupling library. The two connections are distinct but strictly interconnected.
The adapter has the advantage of being completely independent from both the preCICE library and MBDyn. The first connection is achieved via the API given by the library \texttt{libprecice.so}, the second connection exploits the API given by MBDyn through its library \texttt{libmbc.so}.


\section{Structure of the code}

The code for the adapter is available through a public git repository\footnote{\href{https://gitlab.com/Ccaccia73/mbdyn-adapter-test/-/tree/develop}{mbdyn-beam-adapter}}. The code is conceptually divided in two classes, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:adapter-classdiag}.

The main class is \texttt{MBDynAdapter}, which implements the functions given by the preCICE interface. It has access to the class \texttt{MBDynConnector} which takes care of all the aspects regarding MBDyn. Attributes, methods and operations of each class are briefly described in the following sections.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Class MBDynAdapter}
\label{sec:mbdyn-adapter.h}

The file \texttt{MBDynAdapter.h} and its source file \texttt{MBDynAdapter.cpp} implements all the methods required to perform and FSI simulation with MBDyn as the solid solver. The basic steps are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item prepare the MBDyn solver,
	\item prepare the interface,
	\item provide access to the mesh and initialize the coupling data,
	\item steer the coupled simulation,
	\item finalize the simulation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Initialization}

In the initialization phase, the instance of \texttt{MBDynAdapter} gets a \texttt{json} file (see Section \ref{sec:mbdyn-adapter-input}) that contains all the parameters useful for the simulation.
Then it instantiates the \texttt{MBDynConnector} (see Section \ref{sec:mbdyn-connector.h}) which takes care of all the operations concerning MBDyn: in particular starting the simulation the creating an instance of \texttt{MBCNodal} in order to have access to the simulation.

In the next step an instance of \texttt{precice::SolverInterface} is initialized and configured with all the relevant information data:

\begin{itemize}
	\item preCICE configuration file (see Section \ref{sec:pc-config} and Appendix \ref{app:pc-config-file}).
	\item \textit{participant} (i.e. solver) name
	\item information regarding the data to be read and written
\end{itemize} 

The next initialization step concerns the definition of the interface mesh. The data concerning the vertices is stored in the \texttt{MBDynConnector} to be used to plot the output and is passed to the \texttt{SolverInterface} to define the wet surface nodes. The mesh nodes are stored in the same text file that is used by MBDyn to build the \texttt{external structural mapping} information (see Section \ref{sec:mbd-forces}). This means that the MBDyn mapped points coincide with the interface mesh on the structural side (note that it doesn't have to be the same mesh of the fluid side, as preCICE can map non identical meshes, as described in \ref{sec:pc-map}). The suitable size of memory is then initialized to contain the coupling information: mainly \textit{displacements}, to be written on the preCICE interface, and \textit{forces}, to be read from the interface.


\subsubsection{Execution}

The simulation phase of the adapter follows the steps briefly described in Section \ref{sec:pc-api} and in Appendix \ref{app:pc-api}. The most important elements of the codeare  illustrated in listing \ref{lst:adapter-exec}.

The main execution phases include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item read initial checkpoint (i.e. reload state if previous iteration did not converge) [line 6]
    \item read \textit{forces} from interface (i.e. get the current available fluid solution) [line 10]
    \item copy forces to MBDyn: this step is performed as forces can be scaled by a user specified coefficient during the initial part of the simulation, see Section \ref{sec:mbdyn-adapter-input} [line 14]
    \item make MBDyn connector solve the current simulation time step [lines 16-18]
    \item make MBDyn connector compute force and moment resultants [line 22]
    \item write the \textit{displacements} computed at the current iteration of the current time step to preCICE in order to perform coupling [line 25]
    \item get the interface time step (this would be mandatory in case of different time steps between fuid and solid) [line 28]
    \item check if the current time step is converged [line 31]:
    notify MBDyn on the [lines 35 and 38]. If converged, update time, iterations and write output data (see Section \ref{sec:mbdyn-adapter-output}).
\end{enumerate}

\lstset{language=C++}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=MBDynAdapter simulation execution,label=lst:adapter-exec]
void MBDynAdapter::runSimulation(){
	// Start coupling:
	while (interface->isCouplingOngoing()){

		if(interface->isActionRequired(cowic)){
			interface->fulfilledAction(cowic);
		}

		// read forces from interface
		interface->readBlockVectorData(forceID, vertexSize, vertexIDs, forces);

		// copy forces to connector with coefficient
		conn->computeForces(forces,coeff);

        // MBDyn solves the current iteration
		if(conn->solve()){
			conn->writeVTK(iteration);
			break;
		}
        
        // compute force and moment resultants on the structure
		conn->computeResultants(true, root);

		// write data to interface
		interface->writeBlockVectorData(displID, vertexSize, vertexIDs, displacements);

		// advance time step
		precice_dt = interface->advance(precice_dt);

		// Checkpoint
		if(interface->isActionRequired(coric)){
			// timestep not converged
			interface->fulfilledAction(coric);
			// tell MBDyn that time step not converged
			conn->putForces(false);
		}else{
			// timestep converged
			conn->putForces(true);
			iteration++;
			t += precice_dt;
			conn->writeVTK(iteration);
		}
	}
}

\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Finalization}

In the finalization phase all the object used during the simulation are closed and memory released.

\subsection{Class MBDynConnector}
\label{sec:mbdyn-connector.h}

The class \texttt{MBDynConnector} takes care of all the operations related to MBDyn and the structural side of the simulation. 

\subsubsection{Initialization}

The instance of \texttt{MBDynConnector} is initialized within the \texttt{MBDynAdapter} and some different tasks are performed in this phase.

The first task is to read the mesh of interface points. The mesh file location is passed through the input file: to avoid too much duplication, it is the same file used by MBDyn to build the mapping matrix before the simulation (see Section \ref{sec:mbd-forces}). The mesh file contains information concerning the interface points and the connectivity. The $(x,y,z)$ coordinates are passed to preCICE to build the structural part of the interface mesh. The same points, together with the connectivity, are stored in the \texttt{MBDynConnector} and are used to write the output in \textit{VTK} format during the simulation (see Section \ref{sec:mbdyn-adapter-output}).

The following task consists in starting MBDyn. The input file location is passed through the input file and a separated process is spawned with the parameters required to run an MBDyn program. Upon a correct initialization, the MBDyn simulations hangs waiting for an external connection (i.e. the \texttt{external structural mapping}).

Finally, an instance of \texttt{MBCNodal} is created to take care of the communication with MBDyn: a socket is opened and the communication is initialized. 


\subsubsection{Execution}

During the execution phase, \texttt{MBDynConnector} steers the simulation on the MBDyn side. Some of the actions have been already introduced in listing \ref{lst:adapter-exec}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item send \textit{forces} to the \texttt{external structural mapping} points
    \item perform the simulation step
    \item retrieve \textit{displacements}
    \item inform MBDyn that the time step has converged or not
\end{itemize}

If the time step has converged and at a user defined interval, the simulation data are saved.


\section{Input parameters}
\label{sec:mbdyn-adapter-input}

Some input data are needed in order to perform a simulation. Such data are stored in a \texttt{json} file\footnote{see for example \href{https://www.json.org/json-en.html}{json.org} for some information about the syntax}. The file is given as input in the form:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
mbdyn-beam-adapter -f config.json
\end{lstlisting}

An example of input file is given in Appendix \ref{app:mbd-config-file}. The type of data can be related to different aspects of the simulation:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item preCICE
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{precice-config}: the interface must be initialized with the \textit{preCICE configuration file} (see Section \ref{sec:pc-config} and Appendix \ref{app:pc-config-file})
        \item \texttt{readDataName}: label of the data to be read from the interface (typically forces)
        \item \texttt{writeDataName}: label of the data to be written (typically displacements)
        \item \texttt{participantName}: label the participant in the FSI simulation
        \item \texttt{meshName}: label of the interface mesh in the FSI simulation
    \end{itemize}
    \item MBDyn
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{mesh}: location of the file containing the points mapped in MBDyn
        \item \texttt{mbdyn-input}: input file name to be passed to MBDyn
        \item \texttt{node-socket}: name of the socket to exchange data between the adapter and MBDyn (the name has been made configurable to allow different simulations to run in parallel using different sockets: the user must take care to use the same name in the MBDyn input file)
        \item \texttt{mbdyn-output}: location and prefix of all MBDyn related output files (see Section \ref{sec:mbd-output} and Appendix \ref{sec:mbdyn-output-file}).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Simulation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{displacement-delta}: Boolean value that tells the adapter whether to pass the relative displacement between two consecutive iterations or the displacement from the initial configuration. This is mainly due to compatibility with different fluid adapters (e.g. the current version of the \textit{SU2 adapter} requires delta displacements)  
        \item \texttt{iterstart}: the following four parameters are used to give progression to the forces applied to the structure (Figure \ref{fig:sim-coeff} gives an example of the behavior). The purpose is to ease the beginning of the simulation, letting the flow settle and avoiding initial spikes in the application of the forces that could result in a diverging simulation.
        The current parameter tells \texttt{MBDynConnector} how many iterations to perform with a reduced starting coefficient (200 in the example)
        \item \texttt{coeff0}: this value is the initial coefficient ($0.1$ in the example)
        \item \texttt{period}: this value is the number of iterations to reach 1 (600 in the example)
        \item \texttt{ramp-type}: label defining the type of ramp. A linear law or a $1/2 \cdot (1-\cos)$ law can be used
    \end{itemize}
    \item Output (see Section \ref{sec:mbdyn-adapter-output} for some more details)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{write-interval}: value that defines how often the \texttt{MBDynConnector} writes output data
        \item \texttt{resultant-file}: location of the file containing the resultant and moment of the fluid forces applied to the structure. 
        \item \texttt{root-coords}: vector containing the coordinates of the point about which the resultant moment has to be computed
        \item \texttt{vtk-output}: location and prefix of the output file. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Some parameters are used for debug purposes and might be removed in future releases
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{pre-iteration}: number of simulation iterations performed by MBDyn before coupling with the fluid solver. This can ease the initial coupling in case the definition of the structural model isn't in equilibrium
        \item \texttt{read-coords}: Boolean value used to read the mapped points coordinates back in the adapter from MBDyn instead of reading the mesh file. 
        \item \texttt{every-iteration}: Boolean value used to force the adapter to write output data at each coupling iteration 
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Output results}
\label{sec:mbdyn-adapter-output}

Besides the output strictly related to preCICE, concerning information about convergence and number of iterations, or the output strictly related to the MBDyn solution (see Appendix \ref{sec:mbdyn-output-file}), the adapter gives two types of output.

The infomration concerning the interface mesh points is saved in \texttt{vtu} file format, which is a binary XML VTK  file format used to store data on unstructured grids of points. A sequential number corresponding to the current iteration is appended to the name of the file so that any visualization software (e.g. \textit{ParaView}\footnote{\href{https://www.paraview.org/}{paraview.org}}) can load the whole dataset as a time series. Each file contains the following vector data:

\begin{itemize}
    \item displacement
    \item displacement delta
    \item velocity
    \item nodal force
\end{itemize}

for each node. An example of visualization is given in Figure \ref{fig:vtk-out}. For debug purposes also the area and the normal of each cell can be saved. 

output: VTK and resultants

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/vtk_disp.png}
	\caption{Output data in VTU format}
	\label{fig:vtk-out}
\end{figure}

The second output file contains the resultant and the moment applied to the structure by the fluid forces.

Each line of the file has the form:
\begin{verbatim*}
t Fx Fy Fz Mx My Mz c
\end{verbatim*}

where $t$ is the current time step, $F_x, F_y, F_z$ are the components of the resultant, $M_x, M_y, M_z$ are the components of the moment (the point is defined in the input file) and finally $c$ is the coefficient applied to the nodal forces (see Figure \ref{fig:sim-coeff}).
