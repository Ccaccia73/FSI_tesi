%First and foremost, I would like to deeply thank my supervisor, Benjamin Uekermann, for
%his support. His vivid interest on the topic and his very helpful advices made my thesis a
%very pleasant learning experience.


%Additionally, I would like to thank Lucía Cheung Yau, whose excellent work I had the
%challenging mission to continue. Her aid in the beginning of my Thesis was invaluable. I
%also want to thank Babak Gholami for kindly providing us with the results of Lucía’s thesis,
%which was written in cooperation with SimScale GmbH.
%The tools I used in my thesis, mainly preCICE and OpenFOAM, are developed as
%free/open source software. They are also based on other free software projects, including
%the Doxygen documentation generator. Projects like these make me feel very glad of
%the free software community and I hope that my contribution will also be useful.
%The TUM English Writing Center helped me improve my understanding of the English
%language and the clarity of my prose. I am very thankful for the time they devoted to me
%during the Thesis Writers’ Workshop, as well as to our individual appointments.
%My Master’s studies were financially aided by a scholarship from the German Academic
%Exchange Service (DAAD) and I am very grateful of their support.
%Finally, I owe my deepest gratitude to my friends and family, whose endless support was
%crucial for my studies. Special thanks go to my parents and to my friend Myrto, who were
%there when their support was needed the most.
