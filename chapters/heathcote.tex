\section{Flapping Wing simulation}

An application example of \acrshort{precice}-\acrshort{mbdyn} coupling in the study of \acrshort{fsi} problems can be found in \cite{heathcote2008effect}, in which the effect of spanwise wing flexibility on thrust, lift and propulsive efficiency of a rectangular wing oscillating in pure heave is analyzed by means of water tunnel experiments.

The study shows that, for some oscillating frequencies, a degree of spanwise flexibility yields a small
increase in thrust coefficient and a small decrease in power-input requirement, resulting in higher overall efficiency.

\subsection{Experimental setup}

Before describing the \acrshort{fsi} model and the simulation, it is necessary to briefly introduce the experimental setup.

The study considers three types of rectangular wings, with profile \textit{naca 0012} and with different section properties, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:profiles0012}. The section labeled (i) is considered \textit{inflexible}, the one labeled (ii) is considered \textit{flexible} and the last one \textit{highly flexible}.

	\caption{wing section properties (image taken from \cite{heathcote2008effect})}
	\label{fig:profiles0012}
\end{figure}

Each wing has the following dimensions: $100$\si{mm} chord and $300$\si{mm} span.

The experimental setup is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:0012exp}. The displacement of the root section is given by $s = a_{ROOT} \cos(\omega t)$, where $a_{ROOT} = 0.175c$. The flow velocity $U_0$ is in the range $1-3$\si{m.s^{-1}}. The following dimensionless parameters are considered:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $Re = \frac{\rho U_0 c}{\mu}$: Reynolds number
	\item $k_G = \frac{\pi f c}{U_0}$: Garrick reduced frequency
	\item $S_r = \frac{2f a_{MID}}{U_0}$: Strouhal number at mid-span
\end{itemize}

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/naca0012_exp}
	\caption{experimental setup (image taken from \cite{heathcote2008effect})}
	\label{fig:0012exp}
\end{figure}

Experiments are carried out for the three types of wings in the following ranges: $Re=1\cdot10^4-3\cdot10^4$ and $k_G=0-7$.

The results give information concerning the average thrust coefficient $C_T = \frac{T}{\frac{1}{2}\rho U_0^2c}$ over a finite number of cycles and the mean power input coefficient $\bar{C}_P = \frac{\bar{F_y v}}{\frac{1}{2}\rho U_0^3c}$.

Besides, information concerning the ratio $\frac{a_{TIP}}{a_{ROOT}}$ and tip phase lag $\phi$ are given.

\subsection{Simulation setup}

The experimental setup described in \cite{heathcote2008effect} has been replicated in a \acrshort{fsi} simulation using \acrshort{mbdyn} as structural solver and OpenFOAM as \acrshort{cfd} solver.

\subsubsection{Fluid domain}

The fluid domain is represented by a box of size $1.5\times 0.6\times 0.5$\si{m}, as represented in Figure~\ref{fig:hc-mesh}. The boundary conditions are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item constant inlet velocity for the face at $x=-0.25$\si{m},
    \item constant pressure for the face at $x=1.25$\si{m},
    \item symmetry plane at the root of the wing ($z=0$),
    \item slip walls for the other external surfaces,
    \item no-slip wall for the wing surface.
\end{itemize}

The naca0012 wing has been drawn in \textit{Salome} and exported in OpenFOAM as \textit{.stl} file. The mesh has been built with the tool \textit{snappyHexMesh} and it is composed of 218451 cells.

	\label{fig:hc-mesh}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Interface}

The same naca0012 profile drawn in Salome has been used to generate the interface mesh for the \texttt{external structural mapping} of MBdyn. The interface mesh is composed of 1286 cells (1200 quadrangles and 86 triangles), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hc-interface}.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/heathcote/interface01.png}
	\caption{interface mesh}
	\label{fig:hc-interface}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Structural domain}

The structural model is composed of 10 MBDyn \texttt{beam} elements. Considering the \textit{flexible} (or the \textit{highly flexible}) structure, the stiffness of the wing can be considered completely given by the 1\si{mm} metal plate, as the PDMS, with a Young modulus of $360\div870$ \si{kPa} would contribute with only a small fraction of the overall stiffness.

The stiffness matrix of each beam element is given in Equation~\ref{eq:hc-stiff}, in which $w$ represents the chord and $h$ the metal thickness.

\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix} Ewh &  & 0 & \ldots &  & 0 \\
                          & Gwh &  & & & &  \\
                          & & Gwh & & & \\
                          & & & G\frac{1}{3}wh^3 & & \vdots \\
                          & &  sym. & & E\frac{1}{12}wh^3 &  \\
                          & & & & & E\frac{1}{12}hw^3
    \end{bmatrix} 
    \label{eq:hc-stiff}
\end{equation}

At each of the 21 nodes of the structure there is a \texttt{body} element attached, carrying the mass of the corresponding chunk of beam (both metal and PDMS).

The wing motion is achieved by means of a \texttt{total pin joint} element attached to the root of the wing, which moves the root \texttt{node} with a $\sin(\omega t)$ law along the $y$ direction. The motion starts with a ramp of the  kind $\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\cos\left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right)\right)$ in order to ease convergence.

\subsubsection{Coupling}

The main data concerning the coupling between the fluid solver and the structural solver  are given in Table~\ref{table:hc-coupling}:


\begin{table}[!htb]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ l c  l| c } 
			\multicolumn{3}{c|}{parameter} & value   \\ 
			\hline
			simulation time  & $t$& \si{s} & 2      \\
			step size & $\Delta t$ & \si{s} & $10^{-3}$   \\
			\hline
			coupling scheme & & & serial implicit  $S\rightarrow F$  \\
			coupling algorithm & & &  \acrshort{iqnils}  \\
			displacement rel. convergence limit & & & $10^{-3}$ \\
			force rel. convergence limit &&  & $10^{-3}$  \\
      		interface mesh mapping & & & Nearest neigh. and RBF  \\
			
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{naca0012: coupling parameters}
	\label{table:hc-coupling}
\end{table}

Different experiments have been carried out considering different parameters. For example, a shorter time step is beneficial for a better mesh displacement, at the expense of a longer simulation time. At the same time, convergence limits have an obvious impact on the simulation time, as more iterations are required in order to reach a lower convergence limit.

Finally, also mesh mapping strategy (see Section \ref{sec:data-mapping}) influence the simulation quality and time: \textit{nearest-neighbor} is faster but can be detrimental for mash movement, on the other side, the \acrfull{rbf} mapping gives better results, but for larger grids ($\approx4000$ points) the computational cost of the mapping becomes relevant. Moreover, it needs to be tuned.

\subsection{Results}

Due to resource constraints, only some preliminary results have been carried out fort the \textit{flexible} wing. In particular, the results obtained with a root displacement of $\pm2.5$\si{mm} at $2.5$\si{Hz} with a fluid velocity of 1\si{m.s^{-1}} are presented here. This corresponds to:

\begin{equation}
    Re=10000,\quad k_G = 0.785, \quad S_r \approx 1.5\cdot 10^{-2}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/heathcote/naca0012_disp.png}
	\caption{naca0012 displacement}
	\label{fig:hc-tip-disp}
\end{figure}

The tip displacement is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hc-tip-disp}. After the first settling oscillation, the peak tip displacement settles to around $3.62$\si{mm}. compared to the root displacement, the ratio is around $\frac{a_{TIP}}{a_{ROOT}} \approx 1.45$ with a lag of around $27^o$. These results are much closer to the the ones of the\textit{highly-flexible} wing presented in \cite{heathcote2008effect}.

The first eigenfrequency of the model, computed in MBDyn, is $\approx6.8$\si{Hz}. The first eigenfrequency of the metal plate alone, considered as a cantilevered beam, would be around $9$\si{Hz}. The mass of the PDMS lowers the value, as expected. The amplification and the lag found in the simulation seem to be compatible with those theoretical data, while the experimental model seems to be stiffer. Citing the article: ``the airfoil comprises a tear-drop solid aluminium leading edge followed by a flexible steel plate''. The aluminium leading edge might contribute to the overall stiffness of the model.  

The root displacement considered in the simulation is much smaller than the one used in the article in order to keep the mesh deformation small. This aspect might also be a cause of the discrepancy in the results.
Nevertheless the difference between the experimental and the computer model needs to be further analyzed.

On the other hand, the pitch angle of the wing tip, in the second plot of Figure~\ref{fig:hc-tip-disp}, shows that the wing is torsionally rigid, as expected.

The forces and moment exerted on the wing are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hc-wing-forces}. Focusing on the force on the $x$-direction, it is possible to compute the  average $C_D$:

\begin{equation}
 \bar{C}_D  = \frac{\bar{F}_x}{\frac{1}{2} \rho U_0^2 c\cdot b} \approx 0.02615   
\end{equation}

which is close to the values $0.0245\div0.028$ presented in the sources of the article.

\end{figure}



The number of required iterations is, in this model, very stable: 15 iterations are required at each time step to converge, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hc-iterations}. As in the previous examples, nodal forces converge slower than displacements.

Finally some images taken from the fluid and the solid side of the simulation are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hc-fluid-sol} and in Figure~\ref{fig:hc-solid-sol}.
